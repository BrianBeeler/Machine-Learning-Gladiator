# Machine-Learning-Gladiator
This will will provide some practical intuition around machine learning.


# Goal: make out-of-the box, apply them to different datasets. The project is awesome for 3 main reasons:

3 reasons:

- Build intuition for model-to-problem fit. Which models are robust to missing data?
- Which models handle categorical features well? Yes, you can dig through textbooks to find the answers, but you'll learn better by seeing it in action.

Second:

The invaluable skill of prototyping models quickly. In the real world, it's often difficult to know which model will perform best without simply trying them.

Finally, this exercise helps you. master the workflor of model building. For example, you'll get to practice:

- Important data
- Cleaning data
- Splitting it into train/test or cross-validation sets
- Pre-processing
- Transformations
- Feature engineering
